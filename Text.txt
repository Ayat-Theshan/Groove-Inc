Lesson 1 Grid
Grid System = 12 Units
Large scale     lg 
/medium scale   md 
small scall     sm 
Extra small     xs 

when we don't specify for all screen:
medium sets medium and Large
small sets small, medium and large .. etc

To hide/show div in certin sizes:    hidden-md, hidden-lg, ..etc
                                     visible-md visible-lg, ...etc

using class="clearfix"    // to clear float

we can set offset the same ways as in a class to take percentage of grid:
col-lg-offset-3:    // blank in third of the space in lg screen as in 12/3 = 4 = 25% margin

col-lg-3-push:  push to after third
col-lg-3lpull:  pull till the third

class="img-responsive-center-block": sets the image size to grid size
class="lead" : for paraghraph
-----------------------------------------
Lesson 2 Navbar Component:
navbar-inverse: to reverse color
navbar-fixed:   fix at top when scrolling
* always set padding:70px for body
-------------------------------------
row class automatically give margin (-15) left and right so we have to set device size or it sticks to screen sides
